# Portfolio Build

## Description

This project was to build a portfolio for yourself that can be used in career development. It is to use the CSS we learned in class. We were told by the TAs that we can create our own template and did not have to create a page based upon the supplied image.

```md
The goal for the webpage is to meet accessibility standards. The source code should:
1. The portfolio page is to include:
    1. Developer's name
    2. A recent photo of the developer
    3. Links to sections:
        1. About the developer
        2. Their work
        3. Contact links
2. The UI should scroll to the corresponding section when clicking on a link
3. Clicking on an application image should open the page to that application
4. Provide a responsive web page layout for when it is resized.
5. Provide a meaningfule README.md
```
